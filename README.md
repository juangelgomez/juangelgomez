- 👋 Hi, I’m @juangelgomez, an eighth-semester Business Administration student at Universidad Externado de Colombia. I have a strong interest in finance, data analytics, and languages.
  
- 👀 My passion for finance began in my second semester when I worked as an Accounting Teaching Assistant. Since then, I have been a Student Assistant at my faculty's Office of         International Relations, where I advise students interested in outbound mobility programs and support international students studying at Externado.
  
- 🌱 I am expanding my knowledge in business analytics, improving my skills in SQL, Excel, and R. Additionally, I have been deepening my understanding of finance through personal investments, staying up to date with market trends and corporate news. I am also exploring investment alternatives such as futures and options.
  
- 💞️ I aspire to work in multinational companies, contribute to the development of FinTech solutions, or create platforms that empower individuals to take control of their financial well-being. I strongly believe that if we all manage our finances effectively, our country can achieve greater prosperity.
